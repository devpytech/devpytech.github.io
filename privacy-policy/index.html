This is purely out of the goodness of our hearts, and has nothing to do with any hypothetical unions on any particular continents. Please read every part of this policy carefully, and don't just skip ahead looking for sex scenes.</p>
<p>This policy governs your interactions with this website, herein referred to as &quot;The Service&quot;, &quot;The Website&quot;, &quot;The Internet&quot;, or &quot;Facebook&quot;, and with all other websites and organizations of any kind. The enumeration in this policy, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the users. By using this service, you opt in to quartering troops in your home.</p>
<h2 id="yourpersonalinformation">Your personal information</h2>
<p>Please don't send us your personal information. We do not want your personal information. We have a hard enough time keeping track of our own personal information, let alone yours.</p>
<p>If you tell us your name, or any identifying information, we will forget it immediately. The next time we see you, we'll struggle to remember who you are, and try desperately to get through the conversation so we can go online and hopefully figure it out.</p>
<h2 id="trackingpixelscookiesandbeacons">Tracking pixels, cookies, and beacons</h2>
<p>This website places pixels on your screen in order to form text and images, some of which may remain in your memory after you close the page. We use cookies to enhance your performance. Our website may use local storage on your device if we run low on space on our end. We may use beacons to call Rohan for aid.</p>
<h2 id="3rdpartyextension">3rd party extension</h2>
<p>This service may utilize 3rd party extensions in order to play the song Can U Feel It from their debut album Alive.</p>
<h2 id="permission">Permission</h2>
<p>For users who are citizens of the European Union, we will now be requesting permission before initiating organ harvesting.</p>
<h2 id="scopeandlimitations">Scope and limitations</h2>
<p>This policy supersedes any application federal, state, and local laws, regulations and ordinances, international treaties, and legal agreements that would otherwise apply. If any provision of this policy is found by a court to be unenforceable, it nevertheless remains in force.</p>
<p>This organization is not liable and this agreement shall not be construed. These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA. This website is intended to treat, cure and prevent any disease.</p>
<p>If you know anyone in Europe, please tell them we're cool.</p>

<h1 id="realone">Real one</h1>
<p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.</p>
<p><strong>What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our website?</strong></p>
<p>When commenting on our site, you may be asked to enter your name, email address or other details to help you with your experience.</p>
<p><strong>When do we collect information?</strong></p>
<p>We collect information from you when you subscribe to a newsletter.</p>
<p><strong>How do we use your information?</strong></p>
<p>We may use the information we collect from you to send periodic emails with links to new articles.</p>
<p><strong>How do we protect your information?</strong></p>
<p>None of your information is on our server. The only information that we use is your emails, and those are kept securely by Mailgun, powered by Rackspace.</p>
<p><strong>Do we use 'cookies'?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.</p>
<p>For instance, we use cookies to help us remember if you have signed up for the newsletter.</p>
<p>Our advertisement partner, Carbon Ads, uses cookies to track what has been shown.</p>
<p><strong>We use cookies to:</strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Keep track of advertisements.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Remember subscribers.</p>
<p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings.</p>
<p><strong>Third-party disclosure</strong></p>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information unless we provide users with advance notice.</p>
<p>This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.</p>
<p>We may also release information when it's release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property or safety.</p>
<p>However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
<p><strong>Third-party links</strong></p>
<p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies.</p>
<p>We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>
<p><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></p>
<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a></p>
<p><strong>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</strong></p>
<p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily be found.</p>
<p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page.</p>
<p><strong>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</strong></p>
<p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>
<p><strong>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>
<p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>
<p><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></p>
<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
<p><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong></p>
<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
<p><strong>We collect your email address in order to:</strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</p>
<p><strong>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Identify the message in some reasonable way.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</p>
